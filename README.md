# Rex86 (Register Expert x86)

## Project Info
**Author: Diego Borgo**

**ASU Barrett Honors Thesis**

## Goals
- Create a learning companion that assists students with helpful tips and steps to recreate class curriculum activities.
- Integrate within the x86 emulator, to accompany the user as they experiment.
- Provide information about what is happening on the screen or lesson plans to follow to recreate lecture ideas from class.
- Offer supplementary assistance to help students learn in CSE 230 even quicker.
- Serve as a blueprint for a useful add-on to any future web services that may be integrated with class curriculum.

## Implementation Goals

- Communicate with CSE 230 professors and interact with the course curriculum to understand what assistance students need while using the emulator.
- Research and plan tech stack and development steps to implement the companion.
- Develop the companion alongside the emulator, integrating it as necessary but ensuring it stays as a standalone tool that can be enabled or disabled.
- Complete and advertise the companion as a tool to help CSE 230 students further.
- Explore possibility of refactoring code for any other classes that may need it.
- Present and defend the companion as my Honors Thesis.

## Tech Stack
